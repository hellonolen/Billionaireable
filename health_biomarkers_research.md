# Top 10 Health Biomarkers for Billionaire Dashboard

Based on research from elite performers, longevity experts (Bryan Johnson, Peter Attia), and professional athletes, here are the top 10 health markers that should be tracked:

## 1. **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)**
- **What it measures**: Variation in time between heartbeats; reflects autonomic nervous system function and stress adaptation
- **Why it matters**: Higher HRV = better recovery, resilience, cardiovascular health, and longevity. Strong predictor of overall health.
- **Optimal range**: 60-100+ ms (varies by age/fitness)
- **Tracked by**: Elite athletes, Bryan Johnson, high performers

## 2. **VO2 Max**
- **What it measures**: Maximum oxygen consumption during exercise (mL/kg/min)
- **Why it matters**: Strongest predictor of cardiovascular fitness and all-cause mortality. Higher VO2 max = significantly lower death risk.
- **Optimal range**: 50+ mL/kg/min (excellent for men), 45+ for women
- **Tracked by**: Professional athletes, longevity-focused individuals

## 3. **HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c)**
- **What it measures**: 3-month average blood sugar level
- **Why it matters**: Early warning for diabetes, metabolic dysfunction. Elevated levels linked to higher mortality, CVD, cancer, dementia.
- **Optimal range**: < 5.2% (Bryan Johnson: 4.5%)
- **Tracked by**: Bryan Johnson, longevity clinics

## 4. **hsCRP (High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein)**
- **What it measures**: Systemic inflammation marker
- **Why it matters**: Most important inflammation biomarker. Strong predictor of CVD, dementia, death. 81% increased mortality when elevated.
- **Optimal range**: < 1.0 mg/L (Bryan Johnson: < 0.1)
- **Tracked by**: Elite performers, longevity experts

## 5. **LDL-C & LDL-P (LDL Cholesterol & Particle Count)**
- **What it measures**: "Bad" cholesterol levels and particle number
- **Why it matters**: Core markers of atherosclerosis risk. High levels = plaque buildup, 70% increased CVD mortality.
- **Optimal range**: LDL-C < 70 mg/dL, LDL-P < 700 nmol/L (Bryan Johnson: 45 / 509)
- **Tracked by**: Longevity clinics, preventive cardiologists

## 6. **Testosterone**
- **What it measures**: Primary male sex hormone (also important for women in smaller amounts)
- **Why it matters**: Supports energy, metabolism, muscle mass, bone density, brain health, libido. Low = 40% higher mortality risk.
- **Optimal range**: > 450 ng/dL for men (Bryan Johnson: 941), 15-70 ng/dL for women
- **Tracked by**: High performers, anti-aging clinics

## 7. **Vitamin D**
- **What it measures**: Vitamin D blood level (25-hydroxyvitamin D)
- **Why it matters**: Supports immune function, reduces inflammation, aids calcium absorption, protects brain. Low = 26% higher mortality.
- **Optimal range**: > 50 ng/mL (Bryan Johnson: 67.8)
- **Tracked by**: Longevity experts, health-conscious individuals

## 8. **Omega-3 Index**
- **What it measures**: EPA + DHA fatty acids in red blood cell membrane
- **Why it matters**: Anti-inflammatory, improves cardiovascular health, enhances insulin sensitivity. Low = 21% increased mortality.
- **Optimal range**: > 8% (Bryan Johnson: 9.98%)
- **Tracked by**: Elite athletes, longevity clinics

## 9. **Cortisol**
- **What it measures**: Primary stress hormone
- **Why it matters**: Chronically high = extreme fatigue, poor recovery, muscle loss, metabolic dysfunction. Critical for performance optimization.
- **Optimal range**: Morning 6-23 mcg/dL, Evening < 10 mcg/dL
- **Tracked by**: Professional athletes, high performers

## 10. **Fasting Insulin & Glucose**
- **What it measures**: Blood sugar and insulin levels after 8+ hour fast
- **Why it matters**: Early markers of insulin resistance (insulin goes abnormal before glucose). Critical for metabolic health and longevity.
- **Optimal range**: Glucose 70-85 mg/dL, Insulin < 5 μIU/mL (Bryan Johnson: 3.0)
- **Tracked by**: Longevity experts, metabolic health clinics

## Honorable Mentions (11-15):
11. **Sleep Quality** - Total sleep time, deep sleep %, REM sleep %, sleep efficiency
12. **Body Composition** - Lean muscle mass, body fat %, visceral fat
13. **Blood Pressure** - Systolic/diastolic, resting heart rate
14. **Liver Enzymes (AST/ALT)** - Liver function, metabolic health
15. **Kidney Function (Cystatin-C)** - More sensitive than creatinine for kidney health
